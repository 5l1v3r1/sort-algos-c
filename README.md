# Sort Algos in C
Sort Algorithm General Implementations in C Language



- `sort-algos-int.c` is the most naive version. Every C programming language beginner could understand it.
- `sort-algos-int-with-func.c` is the more advanced version based on `sort-algos-int.c`. In this sort of sorting algorithms, we implement the sorting algorithms with `cmp_func` to define the sorting rules.
- `sort-algos.c` is the most general version to sort any kind of data type with any kind of sorting rules. For more information or usage of the most general version of sorting algorithms, you may find it in `sort-algos/sort-test.c`
